  Hello #{@user.name}!
%p We heard that you lost your password. Sorry about that!
%p But don't worry! You can use the following link to reset your password:
%p= link_to 'Reset my password', user_reset_password_url(token: @token)
%p
  (If you don't use this link within #{Auth.reset_password_token_ttl.inspect}, it will expire.)
%p If you didn't request this, please ignore this email. Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.
